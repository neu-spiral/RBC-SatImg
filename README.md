We introduce the recursive Bayesian classifier (RBC), which converts any instantaneous classifier into a robust online method through a probabilistic framework that is resilient to non-informative image variations.

This repository contains the official implementation and resources for the paper: 'Recursive Classification of Satellite Imaging Time-Series: An Application to Land Cover Mapping', published in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (2024).

## üö¶ Additional Resources and Simpler Code (`main` branch)

---
For users looking for a simpler version of the code, we recommend checking out the `main` branch of this repository. This branch is ideal for researchers aiming for a minimal setup to run the RBC framework with:

- Their own data for experimentation, with or without labels:
  - **With labels**: The framework computes error maps and classification accuracy by comparing the labels to the classification results.
  - **Without labels**: The framework simply plots the classification maps.
- Our data, by downloading Version 3 of the Zenodo dataset, which contains only the images and labels necessary for running the experiments.



### Current Branch: `main-precomputed-results`

This branch is designed for users who want to replicate the results presented in the paper using our dataset, available in Zenodo Versions 3 and 4. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Zenodo Version 3**:
  - Contains the necessary Sentinel-2 images and data for running experiments from scratch.
  
- **Zenodo Version 4**:
  - Includes everything from Version 3, plus precomputed results. These results allow for faster reproduction of the figures and findings presented in the paper without requiring computationally expensive simulations.

This branch supports both approaches:
1. **Run experiments from scratch** using our data from either Version 3 or 4.
2. **Directly regenerate paper figures** by leveraging the precomputed results included in Zenodo Version 3.

## üöÄ Getting Started

---
### 1. Install Required Dependencies
Begin by completing the steps outlined in the Installation section to set up the required environment and dependencies.

### 2. Configure Parameters
Edit the `configuration.py` file to customize the parameters for your specific use case. Here‚Äôs what you need to adjust:
- **Set the Zenodo Path**: update `Config.path_zenodo` to point to the folder where you stored the downloaded Zenodo dataset.
- **Download DeepWaterMap Checkpoints** from [DeepWaterMap GitHub Repository](https://github.com/isikdogan/deepwatermap/tree/master/checkpoints) and set the path in `Config.path_checkpoints_deepwatermap`.  
- **Choose the Test Site** by modifying `Config.test_site` to specify which test site you want to evaluate. Example:
- Look for areas in the `Config` class marked with `TODO` comments to customize training or evaluation.  Specify whether you want to:
  - **Generate results again**: Perform training and evaluation from scratch.
  - **Reproduce figures with precomputed results**: Use precomputed results in Zenodo (Version 3).

### 3. Run the Main Script
Execute the main script to perform training and evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

--- 

### 1. Install GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) üåç 
GDAL is a required dependency for this project. Follow one of these methods to install it:
* **Windows Users:** Follow [this guide](https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-for-python-with-pip-on-windows/) to install GDAL with pip.
* **Anaconda Users** (Windows, Linux, macOS): Follow [this guide](https://opensourceoptions.com/blog/how-to-install-gdal-with-anaconda/). Use the following command in the Anaconda Prompt to install GDAL:

  `conda install -c conda-forge gdal` 

### 2. Install Other Python Packages
* This project requires additional Python libraries. To install them, run the following command from the repository's root directory:

  <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

* If you encounter issues with unrecognized modules, consider installing problematic packages separately as suggested in the _Installation via pip and conda_ section from [this guide](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/install.html). For example:

  <code>python -m pip install -U pip python -m  </code>
  
  <code> pip install -U scikit-image</code>

* **Install TensorFlow for macOS (M1/M2 chips):** Follow [this detailed guide](https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706). Using Miniconda is highly recommended for compatibility.

### 3. Download the Dataset from Zenodo (Version 3, specific to this GitHub branch)
The dataset *RBC-SatImg: Sentinel-2 Imagery and WatData Labels for Water Mapping* is available for download from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/12345678). Version 3 of this dataset supports the replication of results presented in the paper and includes:

#### Contents
1. **Sentinel-2 time-series imagery**:
   - Oroville Dam (CA, USA) and Charles River (Boston, MA, USA) for water mapping.
   - Amazon Rainforest (Brazil) for deforestation detection.
   
2. **RBC-WatData dataset**:
   - Manually generated water mapping labels for Oroville Dam and Charles River regions.
   - Suited for multitemporal land cover and water mapping research, accounting for dynamic label evolution over time.

3. **Pre-computed results** for reproduction of paper figures:
   - Instantaneous classification results for various methods (e.g., GMM, LR, SIC, WN, DWM).
   - Posterior results using the Recursive Bayesian Classifier (RBC) framework.
   - Sensitivity analysis results.

4. **Amazon Rainforest imagery and labels** from the MultiEarth Challenge dataset for deforestation experiments.

#### Setup Instructions
1. **Download the dataset**:
   - Retrieve the dataset from the [Zenodo link](https://zenodo.org/record/12345678) and extract the `.zip` file.
   
2. **Configure paths**:
   - Update the `path_zenodo` attribute in the `Config` class within `configuration.py` to point to the extracted folder location.
   
3. **Dataset Usage**:
   - Sentinel-2 imagery is used for training and evaluation.
   - Pre-computed results in `./evaluation_results/` allow reproducing figures and findings in the paper without re-running computationally expensive simulations.

## üåç  Study Areas

---
The paper examines three geographical regions using Sentinel-2 satellite data to test the Recursive Bayesian Classifier (RBC) framework:

1. **Oroville Dam, California, USA**  
   - **Focus**: Water mapping of a reservoir and downstream river.
   - **Challenges**: Seasonal water level changes, ripples, and solar angle variations that create artifacts in imagery.  
   - **Labels**: Manually generated water mapping labels were created for evaluation due to the lack of pre-existing labeled time-series data.

<div align="center">
<img src="plot_figures/readme_figures/site_1.jpg" alt="SITE 1" width="600"/>
</div>

2. **Charles River Basin, Massachusetts, USA**  
   - **Focus**: Water mapping of urban rivers and harbor areas.
   - **Challenges**: Cyanobacterial blooms, reflective surfaces from buildings, and seasonal variations affecting classification accuracy.  
   - **Labels**: Manually generated water mapping labels were also created here for evaluation.

<div align="center">
<img src="plot_figures/readme_figures/site_2.jpg" alt="SITE 2" width="600"/>
</div>

3. **Amazon Rainforest, Brazil**  
   - **Focus**: Deforestation detection.  
   - **Challenges**: High cloud coverage and significant temporal spectral variability of vegetated and deforested areas.  
   - **Labels**: Existing deforestation labels were available from the MultiEarth Challenge dataset, removing the need for manual label generation in this case.

</div>

### Additional Note

While the **deforestation labels** for the Amazon rainforest were sourced from the MultiEarth dataset, we manually generated **water mapping labels** for the Oroville Dam and Charles River areas. These labels are included in the publicly available Zenodo dataset to address the lack of open-source labeled data for time-series satellite analysis.
